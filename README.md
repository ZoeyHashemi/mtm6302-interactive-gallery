### Interactive Image Gallery Readme

In This JavaScript code  I power an interactive image gallery with features such as image expansion, download. Below is an overview of the main functionalities:

Image Modal
The script enables a modal window to appear when clicking on an image. The modal contains the enlarged image along with a close button. The modal functionality is facilitated by the classes modal, modalImage, and modalText.
Download Image
Download functionality is implemented through the download icon (.fa-download). When clicked, it creates a temporary link to the image and triggers a download.
Expand Image
The script allows users to toggle between an enlarged and regular view of an image by clicking the expand icon (.fa-expand-arrows-alt). This is achieved by adding/removing the class enlarged to the image container.
